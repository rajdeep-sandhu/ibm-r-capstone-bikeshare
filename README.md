# Bike Share Demand Prediction
# IMB Data Science with R Capstone Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the demand for bike share services in Seoul using historical data combined with OpenWeather forecast data. The prediction model can inform optimising the supply and destribution of bicycles according to demand.

The following components are completed in R running on Jupyter notebooks:
- **Data collection:**
  - OpenWeather API
  - Webscraped bikeshare data from Wikipedia
  - Downloaded project files provided by IBM
- **Data preprocessing:**
  - Using `dplyr`
  - Using Regex
- **EDA:**
  - Using SQL in R with SQLite
  - Visualisation using `ggplot`
- **Linear Regression models:**
  - Baseline
  - Refinements
  - Model evaluation and selection
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Using
  - Shiny
  - Leaflet
- **Project Presentation**
